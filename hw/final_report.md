The final report should be a summary of your contributions and learning in CS 190J and the course that you assisted in as a ULA.

* What course were you a Learning Assistant for this quarter? What are the learning goals in that course?
* List your specific responsibilities and achievements in the course.
    * Were there any initiatives that you took to improve course content and organization?
    * Did you go above and beyond your responsibilities in any way?
* Tell us how you conducted your one-on-tutoring with students in lab sections and in your office hours. Please, highlight specific strategies that you used that worked well.
* What are the most important takeaways that you got from your work on the course you helped with?
* Think back to your debugging session and reflect on that experience:
    * What was your main takeaway from that activity after observing others and watching your own session?
    * If you had to do that session over again, what would you change?
    * What is your main debugging strategy or advice for future 190J students?
* Think back to your teaching demo presentation and reflect on that experience:
    * Describe one thing that you did well in your presentation.
    * Comment on the content of your presentation: do you feel that you provided your audience with information that was clear and sufficient to achieve your learning goals? 
    * If you had to give this presentation over again, what would you change?
    * What is your main piece of advice for future 190J students for preparing their teaching demo?
* Read over your weekly reflections: 
    * did you have a running Google Doc, like we suggested? if not, what were the reasons/obstacles?
    * what stood out to you as you were reading them? how did you feel about them during the quarter? what do you think about them now, after reading through them? 
* Based on your experience and observations in CS 190J, tell us about the aspects of this course that you found valuable and identify areas where you would have liked to receive more training on.
* Optional, but helpful if you have time: Do you have any suggestions for improvements to either CS190J, the course you assisted with, or the LA program in general?
