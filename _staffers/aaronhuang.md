Hello, nice to meet you! My name is Aaron and I am a third year computer science major. This is my first time being an Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA), so I am both nervous and excited to be working with everyone in CS154. 

The past few years of taking CS courses at UCSB has been a wonderful experience for me because of how supportive the CS department, especially the ULAs. Getting support and help from someone who has recently taken the class has been really fun for me, and I hope to be someone who can make your learning experience more enjoyable. 

I actually took CS 154 last quarter with Professor Matni, so I wanted to become a ULA for this class while the material is still fresh in my head. CS 154 is a class that helped me gain an appreciation for the low level processes that occur in a computer, and I hope to help everyone maximize their appreciation for the material by clearing up confusion or guiding you through your problems. Looking at and simulating the entire CPU pipelining process may seem overwhelming at first; but don’t worry, the class will break down each pipelining stage one at a time and it’ll all make sense at the end. 

In my free time I enjoy playing indie games and roguelikes. My interest in these game genres started because I grew up with an old laptop that couldn’t run graphically intensive games very well. Eventually, I came across a game called Cave Story, which was an indie Metroidvania platformer game that was actually able to run smoothly on my laptop. The game grew on me and my love for the indie game genre took off from there, causing me to pick up CupHead, DeadCells, Hades and many more. 

I look forward to working with everyone! Feel free to drop by my office hours T, TR 4:00 - 5:00 pm if you have any questions or simply want to chat.
