Hello and welcome to CS148. I am excited to be one of the undergrad learning assistants for what is one my all time personal favorite classes. This class is CS148 in which students learn how to build a full scale project. Most students in this class will learn choose to build a web application but most projects are formated similiarly. That means that projects will usually have a frontend and a backend and also use a database and a cloud server service to deploy their application. What I when I was in CS148 was a NEXTJS app for both the frontend and backend plus a MongoDB database hosted on a Heroku server. Students are free to build whatever they would like as long as they follow the labs and correct team communication formatting. I really really hope that you enjoy the class. I look forward to working with you all! :)
