Hello and welcome to CS148. I am excited to be one of the undergrad learning assistants for what is one my all time personal favorite classes. This class is CS148 in which students learn how to build a full scale project. Most students in this class will learn choose to build a web application but most projects are formated similiarly. That means that projects will usually have a frontend and a backend and also use a database and a cloud service to deploy their application. What I when I was in CS148 was a NEXTJS app for both the frontend and backend plus a MongoDB database hosted on a Heroku server. Students are free to build whatever they would like as long as they follow the labs and correct team communication formatting. 

There are two main components to this class. They can pretty much be separated as Agile (Team building and communication) and learning new tech stacks. Like I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the tech stacks usually include a frontend, backend, database, and cloud service. Common frontend frameworks include React, Vue, and Angular. These frontend frameworks all use Javascipt. Some common backend frameworks include NodeJS, Ruby on Rails, Flask, and Django. Personally, I am only familiar with React, NodeJS, Flask, and Django. That goes to show some of the enormous breadth that this class can offer. As for the backend, students typically choose to use either Firebase or MongoDB. Both are NoSQL databases and have easy to use interfaces that are accessible by website. Finally, for cloud services, students typically use Heroku or Netlify. Heroku is a powerful tool as it can be used to host both static web pages and servers. On the other hand, Netlify can only host static sites.

Wow, that was a really long description of some of the things that you learn in this class. I really hope that you enjoy the class. I look forward to working with you all! :)
