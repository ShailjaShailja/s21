Hi everyone! My name is Bryan Zamora. I am a second year CS Major. I am a ULA for CS 32, I took the class last quarter (W-21). When I came to UCSB I was actually not a CS major, but I just transferred into the major this year.
I was born and raised in Tijuana, Mexico. Currently living in IV. In my free time I like to play video games, and hangout with my friends (pre covid).
Recently my friends and I have been thinking more of starting to work on some fun projects that we could add to our portfolios.

Even though academics has always been my main priority I also like to have fun, so I always try to find different ways on how I can apply what I learn in class in some interesting way, or try to make the class more entertaining.
When we had in person classes, I would love talking to random people in my classes and making new friends because it would just make them more enjoyable, you would also probably be able to find me in one of the library study rooms with my friends either studying, or talking about random discussion topics.
Once I finish my undergrad career I want to work for a big company for a couple of years to obtain some professional experience. Then I would like to start my own company, in which I would like to use some of the revenue of it to provide scholarships to undocumented students, or students from underprivileged backgrounds. 

During my summers I have taught web development to high school students from underrepresented communities in LA.
While I was doing that I realized that sharing my knowledge with others is something that I really enjoy, which is one of the reasons why I decided to apply to be a ULA.
I also noticed that many students feel intimidated by ULA’s and TA’s just because of their title, but I personally think that it should be the complete opposite. We are also human beings and we know that some labs could be tough but we are here to help you guys succeed.
As a ULA I would like to help making students feel more comfortable with attending office hours, to reach out for help or just to talk with us about anything!
