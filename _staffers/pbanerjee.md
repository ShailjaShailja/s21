Hello and welcome to CS9! 

My name is Priyanka and I am a third year Computer Science and Data Science & Statistics major. I am really excited to work with all of you this quarter as this is my first time as an undergraduate learning assistant! I have tutored in high school, and even in between, I always enjoyed helping others break down problems and help them figure it out since we all walk away from the experience learning something new :) At school, you'll typically see me with my hoard of whiteboard markers, writing code or pseudocode or solving problems on the whiteboards around. 

I have worked in various settings: in start-up companies, partnering with PhD students working in research, with a medium-size company for a Capstone project, and will also be working at a big company this summer. Within these, I have worked in all different environments, such as the medical industry, the environmental industry, and property management. In all these experiences, I have utilized both my CS and my Stats backgrounds intensively, so you can definitely drop by and ask about the nuances about working in the different fields! 

I love baking and watching TV shows with my little sister (Barbie's Dreamhouse Adventures is the bomb and I am happy to convince you of it), traveling to various places, going on hikes, walking in the water at the beach, singing, doing woodwork, and reminiscing on my high school band experience! I got introduced and addicted to Minecraft this summer and am also trying to get into the world of Dungeons and Dragons, so any tips are welcome!

Drop by into my office hours if you have any questions regarding class or if you'd like to discuss Life and its variety! Good luck this quarter and I hope to see you all soon!
