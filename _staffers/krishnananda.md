Hey! Welcome to CS32! My name is Krishna, and I'm currently a fourth-year computer science major, I transferred into computer science from
the Undeclared major, and it was one of the best decisions I ever made! CS32 was one of my favorite lower-division courses because of how much I learned
about C++ and the various programming practices taught. CS16 being my first CS class I had ever taken along with being the first time I had coded, CS32 
was when things started to come together for me! I know a lot of things taught can seem confusing and daunting whether it's pointers and debugging
segmentation faults, or it's understanding how everything in the program works together, or if it's even general questions about how the language itself 
works I'm always here to help! C++ is a powerful language that gives you an amazing foundation in learning how to code, a foundation you'll
appreciate when you move on to other languages I'm sure! 

A Personal Anecdote when I was a student:
I remember one project in particular where the project needed a vector of vectors, this was my first time dealing with a vector of vectors, and I 
made things far more difficult for myself because I created a vector of pointers to vectors. You can imagine the number of segfaults, and generally
how much googling I had to do to try to figure it out. However, it got to a point where I was lost and had no clue how to finish the lab because I was getting
errors I didn't understand and generally was just over my head. I knew I had to get help, but I had never been to office hours for a ULA before but I decided 
to go because I needed help, and I went to the ULA for the course Eric's office hours. Eric was super helpful as he helped me understand my errors and why I
was getting them and was not judgemental at all about my poor design philosophy for the project's requirements and sure enough I got the project done. 
I and Eric actually became quite good friends, and he was one of the main reasons I wanted to become a ULA!
