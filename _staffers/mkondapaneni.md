Hi everyone, my name is Manu and I'm currently a second year computing major and a first time ULA for CS40. I'm really excited to be involved with the class because of my interest in theoretical CS, 
which is the more mathy side of the field. This essentially means that I like solving (or trying to solve) problems that might not have any basis in real life. CS40 
is the main introduction to the many upper division courses that are focused on problem solving, along with proof that your solution is correct. I look forward to helping students in the class learn the 
fundamental skills in these two areas to prepare them for success in the future.

Currently, I just started working on a research project with the Dynamo Lab on graph clustering. Graph's are basically circles/nodes, with lines/edges connecting them. They can represent many real world structures. 
For example, the circles could be people in a social network and the lines connecting them could be who they are friends with. Clustering on graphs is the problem of
grouping together nodes so that nodes in one group have a lot of connections between them, but have very few connections to nodes in other groups. For a social network graph this would correlate to 
grouping together people in the same communities.
Right now, I just started reading papers to get more background on the problem so feel free to ask me questions about this or share any other interesting problem with me.


In my free time I like playing sports and I'm part of the UCSB ultimate frisbee team. I also love to hike, backpack, surf, climb, and do almost any other outdoor activity.
I'm also a pretty big bay area sports fan and watch a good amount of Warriors and 49ers games. I also watch lots of other tv and listen to a lot of music.
Please feel free to come to my office hours to talk about anything from the course material to your favorite tv show.
